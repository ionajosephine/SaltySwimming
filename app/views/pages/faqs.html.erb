    <li class="h3">Why swim in a tidal pool rather than the open sea?</li>
    <li>Tidal pools are typically more accessible and safer than venturing into the open ocean. They provide an opportunity for people of all ages and swimming abilities to enjoy the water.

    <li class="h3">Is Salty Swimming for me?</li>
    <li>Salty Swimming is designed specifically for wild coastal swimmers who want to plan their visits to tidal pools and hidden beaches without the headache of checking surf forecasts for multiple locations. </li>
    <li class="h3">What did people do before Salty Swimming?</li>
    <li>Prior to Salty Swimming, swimmers had to rely on laborious methods such as scouring various surf forecasts or seeking information from local social media groups to ascertain suitable coastal swimming conditions.
