# README

## Personalised Tidal Pool Forecasting
- At present a user can search or manually scroll to a spot on a map where they know a tidal pool to be.
- They can then select whether this pool appears at high tide or low tide. 
- They can add a name and information to the record such as whether there is parking or safety notes. 
- Once saved, the user can see their tidal pools on their dashboard and immediately know when they will appear, according to Tidal data.
- This allows the user to plan their wild swims without any hassle! No need to look at complicated tidal forecasts or trawl through Facebook groups.

## This web application is not currently taking open source contributions. 
When it is has been thoroughly user tested and new features are ready to be worked on
the README will be updated with everything you need to 
create your own tidal pool forecast web app or contribute to this one 🙌🌊
