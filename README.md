## Personalised Tidal Pool Forecasting
A user can:
- Search or manually scroll to a spot on a map where they know a tidal pool to be.
- Select whether this pool appears at high tide, low tide or whether they want to be informed of both. 
- Add a name and information to the record such as whether there is parking or safety notes. 
- Save the spot to their dashboard and see their tidal pools all in one place with the relevant tide times, tide heights and weather for each.

This allows the user to plan their wild swims without any hassle! No need to look at complicated tidal forecasts for multiple locations or trawl through Facebook groups to see when other people say a pool will appear.

## As of June 2024: This web application is not currently taking open source contributions but may be opened up in the future. 
Salty Swimming was happily launched and tested by a small swim group in Cornwall to plan their tidal pool swims. It received good feedback. There were new features that had been requested such as the ability to add photos and swim logs. Unfortunately the cost of maintaining the app was too much for this group so for the time being the project has been paused. I may open this up for open source contributions in future so if you're interested in contributing please send me a message.

If you have a strong and immediate desire to use this code for your own projects you are within your rights to do so BUT PLEASE don't do so anonymously: FORK it and send me a personal message about how you'll use it in line with it's #TechForGood aims. üòá ü§ù üëç
