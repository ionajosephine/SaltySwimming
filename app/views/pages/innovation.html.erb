<p>Salty Swimming is an innovative web application designed specifically for wild swimmers who want to plan their swims efficiently and effortlessly. Built with the aim of simplifying the process of finding the perfect swim spot based on tidal forecasts, Salty Swimming combines tidal data with interactive mapping software to provide swimmers with immediate access to crucial information about when and where they can swim along the picturesque coastlines.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The inspiration for Salty Swimming came from a passionate wild swimmer from Cornwall who recognized the need for a user-friendly solution to streamline the swim planning process. Understanding the challenges faced by swimmers who sought the best spots for their aquatic adventures, especially those who were not technologically inclined, Salty Swimming was created to provide a comprehensive and intuitive platform.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Powered by Ruby on Rails and leveraging Mapbox mapping software, Salty Swimming offers a seamless experience for users. The app allows swimmers to create their own personalized swim spots on an interactive map, complete with essential details such as high tide or low tide requirements. In addition, users can add notes and assign names to each spot, making it easy to recall specific swim locations.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The key advantage of Salty Swimming lies in its ability to simplify the management of multiple swim spots and their corresponding tidal conditions. Swimmers often encounter situations where certain spots are accessible only during specific tidal windows, making it challenging to keep track of the optimal times for each location. With Salty Swimming, this task becomes effortless. By displaying the precise tidal forecast data for each spot, swimmers can instantly determine when and where they should plan their next adventure.</p>

  <p>Prior to Salty Swimming, swimmers had to rely on laborious methods such as scouring various surf forecasts or seeking information from local social media groups to ascertain suitable swimming conditions. This involved time-consuming research and often led to frustration. Salty Swimming eliminates the need for such manual efforts and replaces them with a personalized wild swim forecast, available at the users' fingertips.</p>
