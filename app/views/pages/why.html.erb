        <h1 class="h2">The Why of Salty Swimming</h1>
        <h2 class="h3">Who is Salty Swimming for?</h2>
        <p>🧜🏼‍♀️ Salty Swimming is designed specifically for wild coastal swimmers who want to plan their visits to tidal pools and hidden beaches without the headache of checking surf forecasts for multiple locations.</p>
        <br><p>As one salty swimmer put it:</p><br>

            <p class="italic">“Before Salty Swimming was available I spent a lot of time searching through local Facebook groups to see when and where people were swimming. Calculating it for yourself is a dark art!”</p>

        <h2 class="h3">What’s so complicated about tidal pool forecasting?</h2>
        <p>Tidal pools and small hidden beaches are each unique and most of them appear only at certain tide heights. The fact that they are not always there and that they appear at different times on different days is part of what makes them so special but it also makes it more complicated to plan your visit.</p>
        <br><p>There are three key factors to consider when accurately predicting the presence of these magical spots…</p>
            <br><p>🧜🏼‍♀️ <strong>1. Tide heights fluctuate over time and do <em>not</em> follow the 24 hour clock</strong></p>
        <br><p>Firstly, you need to be aware that the height of the tide, including its highest and lowest point, fluctuates each day and does not follow the 24 hour clock.</p>
        <br><p>If you found a tidal pool yesterday at 10:30 in the morning, you might expect that it would also be there today at 10:30, but that isn’t necessarily the case.</p>
        <br><p>That’s because if the pool is only there for an hour either side of high tide and high tide was at 09:30 yesterday, but today high tide is at 08:45, then the pool will disappear at 09:45, meaning by the time you get there you’ll have missed it!</p>
        <br><p>With Salty Swimming, you get an automatic tidal forecast tailored to your specific swim spots so you know when the tide will be right for the next 7 days.</p>
            <br><p>🧜🏼‍♀️ <strong>2. Tide times vary by location</strong></p>
        <br><p>The second point to consider is tidal heights also vary by location and this variation is not linear.</p>
        <br><p>If you visited a tidal pool yesterday at 10:30 and it was exactly high tide there, you might expect that if you had a friend visiting a tidal pool a kilometer along the coast from you, it would be exactly high tide there at the same time. That isn’t necessarily the case.</p>
        <br><p>That’s because the tidal range, or the time difference between high tides, can vary significantly depending on the local coastal geography. In some areas, the tidal range may be just a few minutes, while in others it could span several hours.</p>
        <br><p>So while it’s high tide for you at 10:30, your friend might have to wait anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour for their high tide to arrive. Or indeed, they may have already had their high tide anywhere from half an hour to a few minutes before you!</p>
        <br><p>With Salty Swimming, the location of your swim spots is automatically included in the calculation. You have a dashboard to <em>instantly</em> show you a summary of when and where will be good to visit.</p>
            <br><p>🧜🏼‍♀️ <strong>3. The actual height of high and low tide also varies</strong></p>
        <br><p>The third point is that the actual height in meters of the tide fluctuates.</p>
        <br><p>Say if you have a tide table and know exactly when high tide will be, if you measure it every day, you might expect it to be the same each time. But that isn’t the case. You may find that it is a height of 5.6 meters this morning, perhaps 6.3 meters tonight, it might be 4.5 meters tomorrow, and so on. The same will be true of low tide.</p>
        <br><p>Why does this matter when you’re visiting tidal pools? Well, if your tidal pool is only present when the tide is low and is otherwise completely underwater, then on days when even the low tide is relatively high, it may be that the pool does not emerge. Likewise, if your tidal pool requires a high tide to be filled, then if you visit on a day when high tide is unusually low, you may be disappointed to find it empty.</p>
        <br><p>How does Salty Swimming solve this? On your dashboard, you’ll see not only the tide times for your swim spots but the actual height in meters for each spot too.</p>
        <h2 class="h3">How will Salty Swimming help me?</h2>
            <p>🧜🏼‍♀️ Given the many factors involved, if you have multiple tidal pools to keep track of, it can be complicated to know which ones will be good to visit and when. But now, Salty Swimming does the hard work for you! All you need to do is dive in... 💦</p>
